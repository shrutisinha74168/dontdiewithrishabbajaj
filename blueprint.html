          <ul class="mindful-points">
            <li><h5>1. Shift Your Mindset</h5>
            <p> Living long and well begins with changing how we think about life, health, and aging. </p></li>
            <li><h5>2. Listen to Your Body</h5>
            <p> Our body always signals what it needs — we just need to start listening and responding.

            But the truth is, we often don’t pay attention to what we eat. Yet, food is one of the most powerful tools through which we can truly change our body — and even our mind.

            Today, the quality of our thoughts, our speech, and our mindset is deeply influenced by what we consume. Unconscious eating creates internal chaos, while conscious eating brings clarity, energy, and emotional balance.

            Ask yourself: is the food you’re eating really nourishing your body?

            Take alcohol, for example — it slows down the body, makes it lethargic. Over time, even if someone wants to quit, their body resists because it has become dependent.

            Our body becomes what we teach it — and food is our first teacher. That’s why choosing the right food is not a small decision — it’s a daily commitment to a better life.

            In a culturally rich country like India, where every city — whether it’s Punjab, Delhi, Maharashtra, or Lucknow — offers different cuisines, it becomes even more important to choose wisely.

            Not all food is meant for every body. What you eat should depend on your lifestyle, health needs, and personal goals.

            Conscious eating isn’t just about food — it’s about how you live.

          </p></li>
             <li><h5>3. Preventive Health: A Plan Before Sickness Begins</h5>
            <p> whenever someone falls sick or his health deteriorates, everyone tries to cure him, the doctor takes him to the hospital, he is taken to the best doctor and treated, but if all these are not required then why not, something should be saved before the person falls sick, we have a plan for this too
          </p></li>
             
            <li><h5>4. Respect Every Part of Your Body</h5>
              <p> From bones to heart to brain — know what each part needs and nourish it accordingly.Focus on how to live meaningfully, not on how to avoid death.
              
             </p></li>
            <li><h5>5. Stop Normalizing Aging</h5>
             <p> We must rethink aging in the 21st century — how to stop old age from controlling our future.<br/>
             </p></li>
            <li><h5>6. Real Fitness Starts from Within: Mindset & Gut First</h5>
             <p> Everyone knows about exercise and diet to stay fit, but what’s truly essential is transforming the mind — and that’s what we often forget.
             As humans, we've even walked on the moon, but rarely do we think about our gut — the root of countless diseases.
             We talk proudly about reaching the moon, yet we ignore the stomach — the very core of our health.</p></li>
            <li><h5>7. Know What Your Body Truly Needs</h5>
            <p> We rarely try to understand what our bones, heart, or brain need — but awareness of this is life-changing. Life becomes truly joyful when we eat, move, and think in tune with what our body and mind need.
